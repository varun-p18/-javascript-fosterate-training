# -javascript-fosterate-training
THIS REPO IS ABOUT MY JAVASCRIPT TRAINING.
AND IT KEEPS TRACK OF MY DAILY PRACTICE.

STEPS FOLLOWED:-  Create a github repo named as javascript-fosterate-training.
                  Create a branch from main branch as per the date(07-02-2022)
                  Create a file name with the topic that you are about to work (ex: variables.js, functions.js)
                  Push the branch to remote.
                  Merge it with master branch before you logout on that day.
                  Fetch the latest from main and merge it with your local main.
                  Again create a branch from the main before you start work on that day
